  "help.disclaimer.s1.content": "For most users, gambling is a source of entertainment and excitement. However, we also recognize that gambling can have negative effects on some users. In the medical community, pathological gambling is recognized as a serious condition.\n\nSince our founding, we have always paid attention to this issue and done our best to help. Our understanding of 'responsible gaming' means that gaming service providers take multiple measures to help reduce the likelihood of negative effects.\n\nThe most important tool for preventing negative gambling effects is education about gambling risks to strengthen users' self-control abilities.",

  "help.disclaimer.s2.items": [
    "Set deposit limits: Before gambling, consider how much you can afford based on your financial situation. Only play with amounts meant purely for entertainment.",
    "Never chase losses: Try not to take huge risks to win back previous losses. Gambling is for entertainment, not a means of making money.",
    "Set time limits: Set gaming time limits and stick to them strictly. Remember, gambling should be balanced with your other hobbies and should not be your only pastime.",
    "Play wisely: Do not play when feeling extremely stressed, depressed, or under pressure. Also, never gamble under the influence of medication, drugs, or alcohol.",
    "Take breaks: When you notice fatigue or inability to concentrate, take a proper break.",
    "One account only: To more easily track time and money spent on gambling, it is strongly recommended that each person creates only one account."
